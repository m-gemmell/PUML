There are four attributes for characters; EYES, MOUTH, LIMBS, and HEART.
Whenever a player controlled character is going to make an action they roll 2D6 and add the modifier of the relevant attribute.
This determines how successful they are.

- 6 or less: Failure
- 7-9: Partial success
- 10+: Full success
- 2 6s: Ultra success

An action is any task or activity the player wishes the character to do that is considered risky or has a strong element of chance.
Most activities inside combat count as actions.
Outside combat the majority of tasks will be handled with narration rather than rolls.

The attribute chosen for an action is initially chosen by the player performing the action.
If the referee is not happy with the choice the player can attempt to further explain, change the action to fit the attribute, or be content in the referee choosing a more appropriate attribute.

## The attributes

The four attributes as tied to the four [Primeval deities](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/). 
Conveniently they are also analogs of the four attributes in FIST so FIST traits can be used in PUML and vice versa.

- EYES = TACTICAL
- TEETH = FORCEFUL
- LIMBS = REFLEXIVE
- BRAIN = CREATIVE
