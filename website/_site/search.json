    "text": "There are four attributes for characters; EYES, TEETH, LIMBS, and HEART. Whenever a player controlled character carried out an action they roll 2D6 and add the modifier of the relevant attribute. This is known as rolling +ATTRIBUTE (+EYES, +TEETH, +LIMBS, or +HEART) This determines how successful they are.\nAn action is any task or activity the player wishes the character to do that is considered risky or has a strong element of chance. Most activities inside combat count as actions. Outside combat trivial tasks will be handled with narration rather than rolls.\nThe attribute chosen for an action is initially chosen by the player performing the action. If the referee is not happy with the choice the player can attempt to further explain, change the action to fit the attribute, or be content in the referee choosing a more appropriate attribute."
