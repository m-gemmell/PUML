Some NPCs have a __PANIC__ score.
An NPC may PANIC when in a stressful situation.

If appropriately stressed roll a D6 for an NPC.
If the roll is equal to or higher than their __PANIC__ score they will __PANIC__.
The NPC then carries out the __PANIC__ text.

__PANIC__ scores range from 1 to 6.
A __PANIC__ score of 1 means they will always PANIC when they make a __PANIC__ roll.
A __PANIC__ score of 6 means they have a 1 in 6 chance of panicking.

__Note:__ The __PANIC__ score is a renamed version of the CHOKE score from the FIST RPG.
