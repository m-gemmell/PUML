Some NPCs have a PANIC score.
An NPC may PANIC when in a stressful situation.

If appropriately stressed roll a D6 for an NPC.
If the roll is equal to or higher than their PANIC score they will PANIC.
The NPC then carries out the PANIC text.

PANIC scores range from 1 to 6.
A PANIC score of 1 means they will always PANIC when they make a PANIC roll.
A PANIC score of 6 means they have a 1 in 6 chance of panicking.

__NOTE:__ The PANIC score is a renamed version of the CHOKE score from the FIST RPG.
