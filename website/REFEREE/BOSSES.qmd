In **PUML** and **FIST** some enemies have **Boss moves**.
A **Boss** can use their **Boss move** **once per mission.**

Bosses act as other enemies in Combat with 2 exceptions:

-   If there are less enemies than **Defence actions** on the **Defence action tracker** a **Boss** can act multiple times.

A **Boss** can use their **Boss move** at any time during **Combat**.
Using a **Boss move** does not affect the **Action tracker**.
