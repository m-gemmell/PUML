# Complications

Complications are negative affects that occurs along with a success when a player rolls a __Partial success__.
They are unfortunately more complicated to implement than a binary success and failure mechanic but they can lead to more interesting outcomes.
This section gives guidance and examples on how to utilise complications.

An important aspect of a partial success is that it is a success.
It can be frustrating as a player to not accomplish the task and then have to repeat the roll to accomplish it.
It is generally more interesting if the complication comes in the form of a downside, a new challenge, or a choice.

Of course sometimes you may think a challenge may require more than one success.
In that case you can use tracker/progress clocks which are also covered.

This section includes:

- [Trolley problem](/REFEREE/TROLLEY_PROBLEM.qmd): Giving the player the choice of 2 complications.
- [Two truths and a lie](/REFEREE/TWO_TRUTHS_AND_A_LIE.qmd): When gathering intel the PC finds two truths and a lie, not knowing what are the truths and which is the lie.
