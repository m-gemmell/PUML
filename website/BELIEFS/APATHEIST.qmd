Although you know the deities exist you find no point in worshipping or worrying about them. You believe they do not care about you. You find meaning in yourself.

## TENETS

- You have one life and body, cherish it
- Only take from others what they can afford to lose or take for granted
- Love your friends, hate your enemies
- Hedonism is encouraged
