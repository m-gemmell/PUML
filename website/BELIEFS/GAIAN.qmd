Life was created by the combination of light, earth, and water. Gaia is life and yearns for unity. Its followers, Gaians, interpret this in many ways. As always unity wroughts division.

Most followers cherish life. They farm, heal others, protect the environment, etc. Some think death is the great unifier and praise the degraders and carrion feeders. An even smaller subset holds hard to the wheel of life.

Gaia is frustrated by how easily others mix with the brownian chaos of Proteus.

## TENETS

- Strive for unification
- Lead and they will follow, rule and they will obey
- Life is not chaos but a complex web of rules
- Use the emotions wihtin you and others as strength

Follow at least one of the below tenets to answer yes to the Primal dice mission reward question "Did you play to your belief?".

## BLESSINGS OF COGNITION

All life is united forming a sort of hyperorganism that is Gaia. Humans are too small minded to fully appreciate its beauty and splendour. Some liken it to a computer where the earth and all its life is enumerating some vast calculation. Others say it is just like any other living system full of evolution and communication. They can all agree that it has some kind of brain & mind.

Occasionally Gaia will bless a creature. It will gain supernatural powers and sentience. It will always be able to communicate with humans verbally or telepathically. Only a few humans have been blessed by Gaia.

## GAIANS

Most Gaians believe in the unification, where all life becomes fully unified and Gaia is born into its ultimate form. However, they cannot agree to how this will come about. Possibly all life will become one type of organism, immortal, and forever multiplying like a cancer. Some believe death is the greater unifier. Others believe in a true hive mind of all life. 

Most believe it is humans instead that should unite as one peaceful and adventurous species. Humans have been blessed with the intelligence and potential to spread life to other worlds. This should not be squandered.

## FORMS

A Form of Gaia represents a group of similar organisms, therefore representing unity of a part of the hyperorganism. They appear to humans as homunculus consisting of the organisms it represents. Some of the most powerful are the Kingdom Forms of bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals. There are many smaller Forms including birds, mould, diseases, tardigrades and many more. 

A Formâ€™s goal is to bring about unification. They attempt this by promoting growth of its flock, converting others into its likeness or destroying anything not like it. In this way the Forms can be mothers of life, cultivators of rot, or sowers of death.
