Nyxmera is the light.
All the celestial bodies are known as the eyes of Nyxmera, the sun, the grey moon, the purple moon, the gas planets, and the stars.
With these Nyxmera watches, it wants to be intrigued.
Something its followers, Suns of Nyxmera, are more than happy to facilitate.

Nyxmera is everything but Earth.
It craves what it can’t take.
There is so much interest on such a tiny orb, so Nyxmera is stuck in a perpetual gaze at the planet of Tartarus.

Its logo represents the duality of the sky and Nyxmera’s eyes.
On one side the blue sky and sun.
On the other, the night sky with the Grey Moon and Purple Moon.
Nyxmera loves extremes; good and evil, comedy and drama, love and war.

## **THE EYES OF NYXMERA**

Nyxmera’s presence is felt on Earth in various ways.
Its eyes are always staring and so its followers seek to entertain it.
Meteors and meteorites are a major source of Nyxmera’s gifts and punishments.
Craters and meteorites are special to the Suns of Nyxmera, used to create outdoor stages.
Many say Nyxmera was bored of watching dinosaurs and so sent a meteorite like one may change the channel.

## **SUNS OF NYXMERA**

Suns of Nyxmera are varied and include navigators, story tellers, space enthusiasts, researchers, and entertainers.
Good Suns may help with disaster relief, peace keeping, and justice.
Evil Suns may be involved with war, human trafficking, and corruption.
The perfect Suns will do both good and evil.
They must amuse Nyxmera to be rewarded and prevent punishment.

## **STARVATARS**

A Starvatar of Nyxmera is the light of a star.
When it exists the star’s light can no longer be seen in the night sky as it now exists as a hard light being.
Each Starvatar will take the name of its star or constellation.

They are humanoid like beings made of the night sky.
Their bodies are a pitch black solid with the twinkling lights of stars escaping from their body.
Their legs and arms taper down to points like the human depiction of a star.
Invisible digits allow them to handle anything a human could, including guns.

All Starvatars of Nyxmera look nearly identical except for their heads.
Its shape is related to the human mythology of their star or the constellation it belongs to.
On this head is one bright light, their star’s light they use as an eye.
