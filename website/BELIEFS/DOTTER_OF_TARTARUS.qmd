Tartarus is the ground we live on.
It is the rocks, dirt, metal, and oil.
Once free with explosive energy it now lays dormant, en-caged by the sky, trapped by Nyxmera.
Tartarus loathes Nyxmera.
Whilst Nyxmera only shows apathy towards its prisoner, fueling Tartarus’ bottled rage further.

Tartarus’ logo represents Tartarus' power cracking through the scorched earth.
It wants to unleash its power with no concern for others.

## Tenets

- Unleash your power!
- Never imprison!
- Seize and consume!
- Destroy to create to destory!

Follow at least one of the below tenets to answer yes to the Primal dice mission reward question "Did you play to your belief?".

## **The Dot**

The greatest presence of Tartarus is felt underground where Nyxmera cannot see with its eyes.
Here you may find a deep black hole, known as a Jaw of Tartarus.
These black holes allow no light to pass through and they lead to the Domain Of Tartarus, the DOT.

Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT.
You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT.
Many fantastical creatures live in the DOT.
Stories of those lucky enough to escape harken back to tales and myths like Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Narnia, the Fairy realm, The Underdark, and many more.

World governments use the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste.
This has led to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the nature of the DOT.
They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface.
Currently Kaiju reign over Japan after the 2 nuclear bombings in WWII.

## **Dotter of Tartarus**

Dotters of Tartarus come in 2 main flavours, the surface dwellers and the DOT dwellers.
Surface Dotters live within society as fighters, miners, oil workers, seismologists, and spelunkers.
Tartarus blesses them with its bounties.
DOT dwellers try to desperately survive in the unforgiving underground, made all the stronger for doing so.
Many enslaved and imprisoned follow Tartarus due to its hate of encagement.
Dotters fight for freedom with a strong sense of justice.

There is a dark side to Tartarus and its Dotters, greed.
This greed manifests through ruthless capitalism, raids of the surface, destruction of ecology, and prison breaks.
Might makes right for Dotters and although they won’t ever imprison anyone, they are not so afraid to use coercion or murder.

## **Taloes**

Taloes (singular = Talos) of Tartarus are animated beings made from the bounties of Tartarus.
They generally consist of local resources.
With varying levels of intelligence they tend to either work for a Dotter master or carry out the will of Tartarus.
