You worship the four deities. You enjoy creating intrigue for the eyes of Nyxmera, the deity of the sky. You fight for justice for Tartarus, the deity of the earth. You stay in the present and go with the flow, embodying the deity of water, Proteus. You are unified in your worship pleasing Gaia, the deity of life.

Polytheists are rare.
Even rarer are the few who who have been blessed by all four deities, like you.
Many see you as a religious leader.

## TENETS

- Strive for unification
- Observe and sow intrigue
- Unleash your power!
- Flow like water to adapt
