## Gravity lift

**Once per mission** you can create 1 gravity lift.
These cylinders of reverse gravity can be up to the diameter of a normal bicycle wheel.
The cylinder extends straight up from the source of gravity of the celestial body/structure you are on.
The reverse gravity has the same force as the gravity you are manipulating.
The gravity lift lasts till you dismiss it or till the end of the mission.

## **Kaiju** 

You can transform into a kaiju no larger than a cargo container.
When you choose this trait, also choose the form of your kaiju.
You get the following when in your kaiju form:

-   Your total **JAWS** score is **+4** and your total **LIMBS** score is **-1**

-   You have a total **HP** of **20** and natural **ARMOR** of **3**

-   Your natural melee weapons deal **2D6 DAMAGE**

All your gear is absorbed into your kaiju form so it cannot be used.
When you return to normal you are wearing and wielding your gear normally.

Your form lasts till you reach 0HP, dismiss it, or till the end of the mission.
Any excess damage you take is suffered by your normal form.

Instead of another **Level up reward** you can choose one of the following kaiju upgrades.
Each can only be chosen once.

-   Gain a ranged attack that deals **1D6+3 DAMAGE**

-   Your natural melee weapons deal **4D6 DAMAGE**

-   Your kaiju form size increases to that of a 3 bedroom house and you gain **+10 HP**

## **Metal eater** 

You have extremely strong teeth and jaws.
You are able to bite through small rocks & thin metal, such as wire metal fences, with no issue.
If you attempt to bite or chew something larger or tougher your **Referee** may ask you to roll a number of D6s equal to the amount of teeth you may lose.
Each 1 or 2 rolled is a tooth that falls out.
If you currently donâ€™t have enough teeth you cannot make the attempt.

**Mission end:** Regrow **1D6** missing teeth.

A full set of 36 of your fallen out teeth & **+1 JAWS**

## **Percussive maintenance**

You are an easily frustrated fixer.
You can attempt to fix, unlock, hack etc., any mechanical or electronic device that is the size of a personal computer or smaller with percussive maintenance.
If so, roll an **EYES** roll and a **JAWS** roll.
Resolve the higher of the 2 rolls.
If the **EYES** is higher and successful you carry out the task based on the intention and the **roll's outcome**.
If the percussive maintenance roll (**JAWS**) is higher you smash the device into pieces, a failed roll results in **1D6 DAMAGE** to you.
