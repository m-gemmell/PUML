<br>

The elusive ever adaptable deity of water. Proteus goes with the flow, loathing stagnation and overworking. Proteus is ever changing, and agreeable, happy to be manipulated by others. Whether forming into clouds by the sun, falling down a mountain, or becoming steam by lava.

When it is affected by others it will also leave its own mark. Beaches formed by the interaction of the moon, water, and land. Clouds blocking the sun. The formation of Islands with magma. In this changing way, Proteus brings life but it can take it away. However Proteus requires balance, it is frozen in the absence of heat and evaporates with too much.

Although easy going by nature it hates forced participation, loathing the order Gaia wishes to impose.

## Tenets

- Flow like water to adapt
- Allow others to shape you
- Respect others autonomy
- Perserverance allows great deeds

Follow at least one of the below tenets to answer yes to the Primal dice mission reward question "Did you play to your belief?".

## Holy water

Holy water is extracted from the avatars of Proteus (Water Bodies). It is an illicit paranormal drug that allows the user to see the flow of time. This can be used by artists to allow a new outlook on life. It can also be used by athletes, fighters, and soldiers to give a reflexive advantage. However, an overdose of Holy water leads to the user turning into water.

## Proteans

The followers of Proteus are called Proteans. Proteans can be found on the waters as sailors, water sports enthusiasts, and navy men. On the land they can be found as pharmaceutical workers, dealers and enjoyers of alcohol and drugs, snow sports enthusiasts, sanitation & transport workers, and firefighters.

Their organisations tend to be smaller and collaborative. Proteans play well and you will regularly see them team up with other faction organisations.

## Water bodies

Water bodies are formed by the presence of Proteus. They freeze where they touch solid surfaces, allowing them to slide. Where they touch air they let off a low constant supply of steam.

They can be described as cat-like, destructively moving about one moment and lazing about the next. They have been seen finding holes or containers and settling themselves into it. As likely, they can be seen barrelling down hills, cutting new rivers through the dirt.

There are also other water bodies that are formed by the mixture of Proteus and another deity. They can be very different compared to the water bodies formed solely by Proteus.
