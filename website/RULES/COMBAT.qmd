**Combat** occurs when 2 or more forces are trying to harm each other.
PCs only are in **Combat** and can take **combat actions** if they fulfil the two conditions:

1.  They are in the **combat** zone

2.  Enemies are aware of them

**Combat** normally ends by defeating all enemy forces or retreating/escaping.
Escaping/retreating may require **non-combat action turns**.

## **Phases**

**Offense:** Players take turns taking **offense actions** with either their **PCs** or allied **NPCs**.
They normally narrate how they want to harm/hinder the enemy with the **action roll** determining the **outcome**.
However, they may perform other tasks.

**Defence:** The **enemy** attacks and the players narrate how they intend to avoid the damage/hindrance.
The player performs a **defence action** turn to determine the **outcome**.

The **phase** changes when X **combat action turns** have been taken (see below).

An **Offense phase** & **Defence phase** equals a **combat round**.

## **Offense outcomes**

**Failure:** **No damage** dealt, +1 extra space moved on **Offense** **Action tracker**

**Partial success:** Character **deals damage** but suffers an **offense complication**

**Success:** Character **deals damage**

**Ultra success:** Character **deals damage** & something amazing occurs

## **Defence outcomes**

**Failure:** Character **takes damage**

**Partial success:** Roll on **defence complications table**

**Success:** +1 extra space moved on **Defence Action tracker**

**Ultra success:** Immediately change to **Offense phase** & something amazing occurs

## **Combat threat & action trackker**

At the start of **combat** the **combat threat** is set to an appropriate level.

Normally **combat** starts on the **offense phase**.

The current **phase’s action tracker** is set to the vertically aligned **Offense** or **Defence space**.
This determines how many **combat actions** can be carried out per **phase**.
This is a maximum of 3 and a minimum of 1.

Each **character** (**PCs**, **allies**, **NPCs**, and **enemies**) can only **attack once per phase**.

Each character can be attacked multiple times per **Defence phase**.

**Tag team actions** count as **1 action** during an **Offense or Defence phase**.
If used during the **Offense phase** both characters can no longer act in the current phase. 

After a **combat action** move the **action tracker** to the next number (3-\>2-\>1).

After the last **action**, change the **phase**.
Set the **action tracker** to the vertically aligned space of the current **combat threat**.

The referee may reduce the **combat threat** when they feel appropriate.
Examples include:

-   Half the enemies are neutralised

-   A boss is neutralised

## **Combat threat levels**

**Level 1:** The players’ crew have an overwhelming advantage.
They may have ambushed their enemies or have carried out a pitch perfect plan leading to combat.

**Level 3:** The normal threat of combat.
Neither the players or the enemies have a particular advantage. 

**Level 5:** The players’ crew are in an overwhelmingly disadvantageous position.
Their plan may have horribly failed.
They may have angered the enemies as they were trying to be diplomatic with them in their base.

## **Complications & ultra successes**

**Complications** can be completely made up by the referee or you can use one of the examples below.

When a player rolls an **Ultra success** **something amazing happens!** The referee should collaborate with the player to determine what amazing thing occurs.
Examples are below.

If you use an example below try to describe how the effect comes about in the game world.
