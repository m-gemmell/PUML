## **Weapons**

**Weapons** can be used to hurt and **Damage** other characters and objects.
Action rolls are always required to deal **Damage**.
When dealing **Damage** roll the specified **Damage Dice** and add any base **Damage**.

Rolling a 4 for the **Dice** of a **Hand cannon (1D6+1 DAMAGE)** would deal **5 DAMAGE**.

**Damage Dice** are always **D6s** and some weapons only deal base **Damage** or none at all.

**Weapons** can also be used creatively, limited by the type of weapon it is.
A light machine gun could be used to suppress fire whilst a blade could be used to cut a rope or cable.

During __combat__ a PC can only swap and/or equip different __Weapons__ between combat rounds (a combat round = the two combat phases).

## **Armor**

When a character is dealt **Damage** they **reduce** the **Damage** amount by their total **Armor** amount.

## **Accessory**

Some **Equipment** have the **Accessory** property.
If appropriately narrated an **Accessory** can be used to negate all **Damage** from one source.
The **Accessory** is then **destroyed**.

**PCs** and **NPCs** can use **Accessories**.

## **Equipment durability**

**Equipment**, such as **Weapons** and **Armor**, have 3 **Durability** states.

-   **Good:** The **Equipment** is in a good state.

-   **Damaged:** The **Equipment** has been damaged.
    This may occur from a complication in combat or otherwise.
    The weapon functions as normal but is close to a **Broken** state.

-   **Broken:** The **Equipment** is irrevocably **Broken**.
    You can no longer use the **Equipment** and it is impossible to fix.
    Normally only **Damaged Equipment** can become **Broken** but a severe complication may cause a piece of **Equipment** to go straight from **Good** to **Broken**.

**Broken equipment** can be repaired with the correct gear or through a **Rendezvous point**.
**Broken** pieces of **Equipment** remain **Broken** between missions unless it is a trait item, in which case it is automatically repaired to **Good**.

## **Vehicles**

**Vehicles** can be driven by any character as long as they have the keys/codes or can hotwire/hack it.

The only stats **Vehicles** have are **HP** and **Armor**.
Once a **vehicle** reaches **0HP** it is no longer usable.
The capabilities of a vehicle beyond these stats are up to the referee and players.

## **Misc**

-   **Equipped weapons:** Only one weapon can be equipped at a time.

-   **Equipped armor:** Only one main piece of armor can be equipped at a time.

-   **Equipped headgear:** Only one piece of headgear can be equipped at a time.

-   **Worn gear:** As much gear can be worn as makes sense.

-   **Trait & belief gear:** Any of these items that are used/broken are replaced at the start of a new mission.
    They do not count towards encumbrance.

- **Encumbrance:** 10 total extra items (non trait or belief gear) can be carried at any one time by each character.
