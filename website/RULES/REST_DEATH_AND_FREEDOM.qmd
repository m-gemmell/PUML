## **Rendezvous point**

Once per mission, the players may request a **Rendezvous point**, and the **Referee** will describe a nearby but difficult to reach safe location where the **Players** can recuperate.

At the **Rendezvous point**, each player may choose one:

-   **REST:** Heal **1D6 HP**

-   **RESTOCK:** Replenish one item or resource

-   **INTEL:** Gain one useful fact about the mission

-   **REPAIR:** Repair **1D6 Durability** across gear

## **0 HP**

When a **PC** reaches **0 HP** they have 2 options.
They can either become **Knocked-out** or perform a **Last stand**.

Most **NPCs** die when they reach 0HP.
Exceptions are up to the **Referee**.

### **Knocked-out**

A **Knocked-out PC** is unconscious and in a critical condition for the rest of the mission.
They must be carried by their team mates till the end of the current mission and subsequently be evacuated out of the mission zone.
**Knocked-out** **PCs** cannot be healed during the mission.

### **Last stand**

A **Last stand** allows a **PC** to perform one final **action** before they **Die**.
Use this as an opportunity to fulfill a goal or want of the **PC**.
Give a strong character driven reason for your last stand and with good rolls your **Referee** should be generous.

Examples of **Last stands** include:

-   Attacking your killer

-   Holding the line for a retreat

-   Self-destructing a base with you in it

-   Saving someone else by taking their hit

-   Carrying out one last hack

This is intended to make the end of your character memorable.

## **Creative freedom**

As a **Player** you are encouraged to make creative plays.
However, there are times when your **Referee** is worried a tactic may be repeated and abused.

To facilitate creative role-playing and problem solving the **Referee** may give you **creative freedom**.
If this is the case your idea will work, possibly needing a successful roll.

However, the same idea will either not work a second time or will work in the future with a much lower efficiency.
If you use the same idea twice and the **Referee** doesnâ€™t remember the first time, then it may have been a big enough gap to use successfully again.
