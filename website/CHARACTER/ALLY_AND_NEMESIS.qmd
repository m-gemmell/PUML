A player can call for assistance from an **ally**.
Each **ally** can only be called on **once per mission**.
Difficult requests may require an action roll to determine its success.

When a request is made the referee rolls a hidden **Nemesis dice**.
They roll **1D6** and if the number is larger than the number of times **allies** have been called for help in this mission (totalled across all **allies**) the request goes through as normal.
If the roll is equal to or lower the request is intercepted by a **nemesis** of one of the players.
The **ally** does not help and the **nemesis** makes life more difficult for the PCs in some way.

The below are only suggestions.
Please create your own as long as the referee is consulted and happy.
Also feel free to use a below **ally** suggestion as a **nemesis** or vice versa.

Through play **PCs** may gain more **Allies** and/or **Nemeses** from the **NPCs** and **enemies** they interact with.

## **Allies**

-   **Academic:** A researcher with interest in something the player character does.
    Constantly asking questions but also very keen to answer any they can.

-   **Celebrity**: This celebrity is a VIP and may be able to get you into a fancy restaurant or party.

-   **Officer in a military:** More likely for the military to overlook what the team is doing.
    Possibly even help depending on the situation.

-   **Doctor:** A good source for healing.

-   **Ex-merc mentor:** A merc who is no longer on the field.
    Their knowledge and merc contacts can be very useful.
    The more flexible they are, the less powerful they are.

-   **Pilot:** Pilot of your teamâ€™s personal transport vehicle.
    Having them on your good side is never a bad thing.

-   **Primeval deity:** One of the deities has blessed you.
    If you take this then take one of the other deities as a nemesis.
    Most likely pairings are Nyxmera + Tartarus, or Proteus + Gaia.

-   **The referee:** You know the referee of this game of **PUML**.
    Seems pretty powerful so there must be a catch.

## **Nemeses**

-   **Bounty hunter/detective:** You have a bounty on your head somewhere.
    This person is emotionally invested in catching you.

-   **Doppelganger:** This might be a clone/the real you/a changeling/an alien/android.
    Any which way it wants to replace you.

-   **Horror:** Something is hunting you.
    It may be an eldritch being or a trans-dimensional creature.
    It could be a revenant of someone you betrayed or a spirit of a land you desecrated.
    You seemingly have no hope.

-   **Primeval deity:** One of the deities particularly dislikes you.
    If you take this then take one of the other deities as an ally.
    Most likely pairings are Nyxmera + Tartarus, or Proteus + Gaia.

-   **Rival mercenary:** A rival who may take on the same missions as you.

-   **Super villain:** Someone with a dastardly plan to change the world in some way.
    You may have foiled their plans in the past.

-   **Taxman:** You washed the slate clean of your previous life.
    They all think you no longer exist, all except the taxman and they demand what you owe.

-   **Time & space bureau:** You are not in the correct time and/or space.
    The bureau has someone searching for you to put you back in your right place.
